# SimpleTracker-v0.1
A simple graphing tool to plot the sensor values from the LeapMotion controller when there's a tremor in the hand. Sensor starts to take readings when it detects the presence of a light tremor in the hand.

This is a fairly barebones code to test proof of concept and is in now way a fully finished product. I will release updates soon to add more functionality.
